As top economics and finance journals now mandate code and data sharing, ensuring credibility and longevity of scholarly work is essential. The maintainers of Tidy Finance hence developed a workshop that equips participants with tools and techniques for **reproducibility**, **effective communication**, and **efficient collaboration**. Participants can bring existing research projects to reflect upon and improve their workflows with guidance from instructors and peers. Prior programming experience is beneficial but not required, as the workshop covers foundational knowledge alongside advanced reproducibility techniques applicable to **any programming language**.
